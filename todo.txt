rework internals to allow for removals
fix StringTreeNodeMut::set_value_at() and make StringTree::insert() use that
implement:
	tree.contains()
	tree.values()
	tree.remove()
	tree.len()
	tree.is_empty()
	tree.clear()
add some sort of self-trimming? (probably needs to keep track of inserted items, removed items, etc)
